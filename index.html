            <p>

                When a modern operating system wants to start running a program, it creates a new process. A process is a program that is
                currently executing. Every process has at least one thread running within it. Sometimes threads are referred
                to as lightweight processes. A thread is a path of code execution through a program, and each thread has
                its own local variables, program counter (pointer to the current instruction being executed), and lifetime.
                Most modern operating systems allow more than one thread to be running concurrently within a process. When
                the Java Virtual Machine (JavaVM, or just VM) is started by the operating system, a new process is created.
                Within that process, many threads can be spawned (created).
