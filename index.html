                You might remember Cracked magazine, the monthly humor magazine that has been around since 1958. While the magazine is no
                longer in publication, the humor site with the same name, and with the same zany sense of humor, is still
                very much alive and well. In fact, Cracked.com has over 2 million fans on Facebook and is read by over 5
                million people every month.

                Earlier in this chapter I stated that the comma operator (not the comma separator, which is used to separate function arguments)
                has only one use in Java: in the control expression of a for loop. In both the initialization and step portions
                of the control expression, you can have a number of statements separated by commas, and those statements
                will be evaluated sequentially. The previous bit of code uses this ability. Hereâ€™s another example:
